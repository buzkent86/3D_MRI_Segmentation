# 3D_MRI_Segmentation

This repository contains the 3-D Cardiac Segmentation code for my work below.

Uzkent, Burak, Matthew J. Hoffman, Elizabeth Cherry, and Nathan Cahill. "3-D MRI cardiac segmentation using graph cuts." 
In Image and Signal Processing Workshop (WNYISPW), 2014 IEEE Western New York, pp. 47-51. IEEE, 2014.

This code is built on top of the Multi-label optimization work from the paper:

Delong, Andrew, Anton Osokin, Hossam N. Isack, and Yuri Boykov. "Fast approximate energy minimization with label costs." 
In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on, pp. 2173-2180. IEEE, 2010.

You can contact me for more details.
